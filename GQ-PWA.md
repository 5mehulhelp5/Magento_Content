1. **GraphQL:**

   **Basic Concepts:**
   - **What is GraphQL, and how does it differ from RESTful APIs?**
     - GraphQL is a query language for APIs that enables clients to request only the data they need. Unlike RESTful APIs, where multiple endpoints return fixed data structures, GraphQL allows clients to specify their data requirements in a single request.
     
   - **Explain the role of a resolver in GraphQL. How does it work?**
     - Resolvers are functions that define how the data for a particular field in a GraphQL schema is retrieved. When a query is made, each field in the query corresponds to a resolver function that fetches the data for that field.

   **Schema and Types:**
   - **What is a schema in GraphQL and how is it defined?**
     - A schema in GraphQL defines the types of data that can be queried and how they are related. It includes object types, input types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions.

   - **Differentiate between Scalar and Non-Scalar types in GraphQL.**
     - Scalar types represent a single value (Int, Float, String, Boolean, ID), while Non-Scalar types represent complex data structures or custom types (Object Types, Enum types).

   - **What are custom scalars in GraphQL, and why are they useful?**
     - Custom scalars are user-defined scalar types in GraphQL that define how values are serialized, parsed, and validated. They are useful for handling non-standard data formats (e.g., DateTime, Email) in a consistent way.

   **Queries and Mutations:**
   - **How are queries and mutations defined in a GraphQL schema?**
     - Queries are used to fetch data from the server, while Mutations are used to modify data on the server. They are defined as special types in the schema and can have arguments and return types.

   - **Describe the advantages of using GraphQL mutations over traditional RESTful approaches for data modification.**
     - GraphQL mutations allow clients to batch multiple operations into a single request, reducing network overhead. They also provide precise control over the data returned, avoiding over-fetching issues common in RESTful APIs.

   **Subscriptions and Real-Time Updates:**
   - **What are GraphQL subscriptions, and how are they used for real-time updates?**
     - Subscriptions enable clients to receive real-time updates from the server when specific events occur. They establish persistent connections between clients and servers, delivering data as it changes.

   - **Explain the use cases for implementing GraphQL subscriptions in a web application.**
     - GraphQL subscriptions are useful for implementing features like live chat, real-time notifications, collaborative editing, and any scenario where real-time data updates are required.

   **Best Practices and Performance:**
   - **What are some best practices for optimizing GraphQL queries to improve performance?**
     - Best practices include batching requests, using persisted queries, implementing caching strategies, and optimizing resolver functions to reduce query complexity.

   - **How can you handle authentication and authorization in GraphQL?**
     - Authentication and authorization in GraphQL can be handled using custom middleware, checking user roles and permissions in resolvers, utilizing JWT tokens, or integrating with existing authentication services.

2. **Progressive Web App (PWA) Questions:**

   **Basic Concepts:**
   - **What are Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and what are the key characteristics that define them?**
     - PWAs are web applications that provide a native app-like experience to users. They are characterized by features such as offline functionality, push notifications, responsive design, and installability.

   - **How do PWAs differ from native mobile applications?**
     - PWAs are web-based applications that run in a browser, while native mobile apps are installed on a device. PWAs use web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering cross-platform compatibility.

   **Service Workers and Caching:**
   - **Explain the role of service workers in PWAs and how they enable offline functionality.**
     - Service workers are scripts that run in the background and intercept network requests made by the PWA. They enable offline functionality by caching assets and data, allowing the PWA to work offline or in low-connectivity situations.

   - **What strategies can be used to implement caching for PWA resources?**
     - Developers can use strategies like cache-first, network-first, stale-while-revalidate, and cache-only to optimize resource caching in PWAs. These strategies help improve performance and reduce network dependencies.

   **Web App Manifest:**
   - **What is the web app manifest, and what information does it contain?**
     - The web app manifest is a JSON file that provides metadata about a PWA, such as its name, icons, start URL, display mode, and theme color. It enables the PWA to be installed on a user's device like a native
